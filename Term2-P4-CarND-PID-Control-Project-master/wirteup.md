# Report for project: CarND-Controls-PID

## Compilation

The code should compile just fine!

## Implementation

The basic PID equation is implemented in `PID::CaculateControllerOutput()` which is a function I added. `PID::TotalError()` did not really fit into how I implemented the PID. 

## Reflection

### Proportional part of controller (P)

The purpose of the P-term is essentially to reach a desired value as fast as possible. If this value is set to high, one can experience overshoot or even severe oscillations around the target value. 

This term did exactly what i expected. If I increased it, the car would preform more "agressive" corrections in steering angle, but if I set it too high, the car would wobble or even drive of the track. 

### Integral part of controller (I)

A P-controller can never achieve zero error on its own, making the I-term useful. This term helps drive the system error as close to zero as possible by summing up the errors over the current and all previous samples. This is all well and good in theory, but it can also result in the system drifiting away from the desired value, since the sum of errors will keep growing over time. 

I took two measures to combat this. First, I kept the gains on the I-terms low. Second, I implemented a very simple "anti windup" mechanism, which effectively saturates the I-term, keeping it from growing indefinitely.


This term behaved as expected; without windup it would eventually make the system unstable. Additionally, it seemed VERY sensitive to "high" values of Ki, relative to Kp and Kd.  



### Derivative part of controller (D)

The main purpose of this term is to "predict" errors. Since it is a function of the current and past errors, it can provide a sharp correction when necessary. It is very useful when the P-term is unable to stabilize the system during large error margins. 

One very important considerations of the D-term, is how it behaves with very noisy signals. If the amplitude of the noise is too large, the D-term can end up amplifying it and make the system unstable. Since this project runs on a simulator, the D-term is fairly well behaved. However,in the real world, implementing some kind of filtering or tracking mechanism before using this term would be wise. 

### Choice of parameters

I chose manual tuning, which arguably is the least sophisticated method, but works well enough in my experience. PID's usually end up requiring some manual attention in the end anyways. 

My procedure for selecting the parameters was as follows:

1. Set all gains to zero. 
2. Increase the P-gain until a disturbance causes a stedy oscillation. 
3. Increase the D-gain until the oscillations go away (critically damped!).
4. I repeated steps 2-3 until the D-gain did not stop the oscillations
5. Assign the last stable values to the P and D gains. 
6. Increase the I-gain until the car was aligned in the middle of the road. 

My final values can be seen in `main.cpp`. 


### Speed controller

At first i had the throttle set to a constant value, but I decided to apply a PID to the throttle as well. 

I tried to use both the speed and angle parameters for this. The main idea is that the speed should decrease when the angle increases (sharp turns). I did this by sending a weighted sum of speed and angle into the throttle PID:

* `input = fabs(speed - (10.0 * fabs(angle))))`

I also had to scale down the final output of the throttle pid by a factor 0.3, otherwise the car would go too fast. 

This is not perfect, since a large enough angle can cause the magnitude of `input` to become very large as well, resulting in too high speed, but it works reasonably well. 


### Improvements

The main areas of improvement are:

* Further tuning of PID parameters
* Better way to set the PID throttle input


## Simulation

As far as I can tell, this criteria is met.
